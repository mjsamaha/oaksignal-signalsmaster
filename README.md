## 📖 About This Project

**Signals Master** is a mobile-friendly web application designed to help Sea Cadets learn, practice, and master naval signal flags and pennants.

Moving beyond static pen-and-paper testing, Signals Master offers an engaging, interactive digital experience that accelerates learning through immediate feedback, structured assessments, and competitive gamification.

**Primary Goals:**
*   **Modernize Learning:** Replace static diagrams with interactive quizzes.
*   **Accelerate Mastery:** Immediate feedback loops for faster recognition.
*   **Gamify Progress:** Ranked modes and leaderboards to motivate improvement.
*   **Empower Instructors:** Data-driven insights into cadet readiness.

## ✨ Features

Designed for both rapid learning and formal assessment:

- **🎓 Interactive Practice**: Customizable sessions (5-30+ flags) with two learning modes: "Identify by Name" and "Match Meaning".
- **🏆 Ranked Competitive Mode**: A timed, high-stakes mode where speed and accuracy determine fleet ranking.
- **📝 Formal Exams**: Structured assessments with immutable results for instructor review.
- **📚 Reference Guide**: A comprehensive, mobile-friendly encyclopedia of all standard naval flags and pennants.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mjsamaha/oaksignal-signalsmaster.git
   cd oaksignal-signalsmaster
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your Clerk + Convex settings and exam security variables.
   Required for auth/backend:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
   - `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - `CLERK_ISSUER_URL`
   - `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_SITE_URL`
   Required for official exam session security:
   - `EXAM_SESSION_TOKEN_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
   Optional hardening toggle:
   - `OFFICIAL_EXAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (integer milliseconds, minimum `60000`; unset to disable idle timeout)

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Security & Quality Hooks

This project uses **Husky** to enforce quality and security standards:

*   **Pre-commit**: Runs `gitleaks` (staged files) and `eslint` to prevent secrets and bad code from continuing.
*   **Pre-push**: Runs comprehensive `gitleaks` scans, basic secret pattern checks, and `npm run check` with formatted progress output.

Pre-push helper flags:
*   `PUSH_CHECKS_FAST=1`: Skip `npm run check` (local troubleshooting only).
*   `PUSH_CHECKS_VERBOSE=1`: Stream full command output live.
*   `PUSH_CHECKS_NO_SPINNER=1`: Disable spinner animation for non-interactive logs.

### Official Exam Security Ops Notes

* `EXAM_SESSION_TOKEN_SECRET` is mandatory for starting official exam attempts. Rotate it with care because existing in-progress exam session tokens will no longer validate.
* `OFFICIAL_EXAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` is optional and server-enforced at answer submission time. If idle time exceeds this value, the attempt is marked `abandoned`.
* Optional server-side submission rate limits:
   * `OFFICIAL_EXAM_SUBMISSION_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` (default `750`, minimum `100`)
   * `OFFICIAL_EXAM_SUBMISSION_WINDOW_MS` (default `60000`, minimum `1000`)
   * `OFFICIAL_EXAM_SUBMISSION_MAX_PER_WINDOW` (default `30`, minimum `1`)
* Optional timing anomaly detection thresholds:
   * `OFFICIAL_EXAM_MIN_RESPONSE_TIME_MS` (default `1500`, minimum `100`; rejects suspiciously fast submissions)
   * `OFFICIAL_EXAM_SLOW_RESPONSE_WARNING_MS` (default `120000`, minimum `5000`; logs slow response anomalies)
* Rollback path for idle timeout: remove/unset `OFFICIAL_EXAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` and redeploy Convex functions.
